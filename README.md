# Metatron Cube – Post-Symbolic Cognition Engine

Metatron Cube is a universal, post-symbolic cognition engine for next-generation AI, complex systems research, and experimental field-based computation.  
It operationalizes a multidimensional information space using resonance, tensor fields, dynamic network topologies, and emergent meta-control — going far beyond classical symbolic AI.

## Key Features

- **Post-Symbolic Logic:** All operations are field- and resonance-based. No traditional symbolic or rule-based logic.
- **Resonance Tensor Networks:** Model and evolve multidimensional tensor fields; simulate resonance, coherence, and singularity events.
- **Quantum-Inspired Operators:** Apply high-dimensional permutation and resonance operators, supporting quantum-like superposition and measurement.
- **Semantic & Diagnostic Layers:** Integrate semantic field classification, spectral analysis, and resonance diagnostics for pattern and meaning extraction.
- **Adaptive Meta-Interpretation:** Built-in meta-control engine dynamically adjusts thresholds, field parameters, and feedback cycles.
- **API-First & Modular:** Clean REST API (FastAPI); plug-and-play for new modules and experimental logic.
- **Dockerized Deployment:** Ready-to-use container for immediate prototyping and cloud deployment.

## What Can You Do With It?

Create and evolve resonance fields, tensor networks, and cognitive spaces.

Experiment with post-symbolic, self-adaptive AI — not rule-based, but resonance-driven.

Develop new modules for reasoning, pattern finding, autonomous control, and meaning extraction.

Prototype knowledge engines, holographic databases, or self-organizing agent systems.

Use as a universal cognitive backbone for symbolic, hybrid, or quantum-inspired projects.

## Quickstart

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/LashSesh/metatron-cube.git
cd metatron-cube

# Build the Docker image
docker build -t metatron-cube .

# Start the container
docker run -p 8000:8000 metatron-cube

# The API is now accessible at http://localhost:8000

---

# Manual (Python):

pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn metatron_cube.main:app --reload

The REST API is then accessible at:
http://localhost:8000
